#### Project Details

This website is a fictitious music application named myTunes. It's built with HTML markup, basic CSS styling and JavaScript. The entire website is garnished by a smooth-scroll effect and is based on a consistent dark theme with alternating light backgrounds. I know you'll love it.

Here's why it's so awesome:  

&gt; The website is fully responsive and scales down perfectly on smaller viewports.  
&gt; The website incprporates parallax scroll effect on larger viewports.  
&gt; Scroll animations add the final touch to this website.
