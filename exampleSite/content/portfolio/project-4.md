### Project Requirements

This automation bot was built with the following tools:

&gt; [Python](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)  
&gt; [Selenium](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)  
&gt; [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)  
&gt; [LightBox plugin](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/)  

### Project Details

This Selenium bot serves to automate the entire login process for Instagram, right from opening the browser, navigating to Instagram's URL and finally auto-logging in to Instagram using pre-specified credentials and bypassing the Save your info page to arrive at the landing page.

Here's why it's so awesome:  

&gt; It bypasses your effort of typing in your instagram id and password time and again.  
&gt; It will open up your personal Instagram feed page without you ever having to touch the keyboard.  
&gt; The entire process is quite fast and works better at higher internet speeds.
