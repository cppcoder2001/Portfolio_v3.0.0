#### Project Requirements

This awesome drum kit webpage was built using the following languages and frameworks:

&gt; [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)  
&gt; [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)  
&gt; [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)  

#### Project Details

This project employs HTML and CSS to build the single-page frontend interface and relies on advanced JavaScript to add the musical notes to the individual buttons that represent the drum-kit accessories. The drum-kit buttons can be easily triggered using mouseclick event or through specific keyboard buttons as visible on the frontend. Give it a go!!

Here's why it's so awesome:

&gt; It brings the accessibility of a drum-kit directly to your fingertips.  
&gt; It's really easy to set up after forking and cloning the source code.
