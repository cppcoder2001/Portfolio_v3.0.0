### Project Requirements

This project is built with the following tools and languages: 

&gt; [Python](https://www.python.org/)  
&gt; [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)

### Project Details

This static web scraper model uses Python and BeautifulSoup to locate and extract the necessary HTML elements from an e-commerce website. Here, I've zoomed in on Flipkart and targeted the web scraper model to track and extract the price value of my customised product from this platform over regular intervals of time.

Here's why it's so awesome:

&gt; Eliminates the hassle of constantly checking the price value of my desired product.  
&gt; Automates your boring process of monitoring and purchasing the product when a desired value is reached.  
&gt; Automatically sends you an email when the price value of the article falls below a certain user-defined bar.
