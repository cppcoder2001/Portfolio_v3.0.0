I'm a passionate full-stack web developer and algorithmic thinker. Ever since my first "Hello World" project in HTML, I've been obsessed with creating and working with web-based code through real-life scenarios and projects.

I specialize in creating aesthetic websites with working backends and I'm currently exploring more about Nodejs and MongoDB.

I'm a firm believer in the continual process of learning and my passion for software development has always motivated me to explore its multifarious aspects and share them with the world.
